**Title: I will be your NMA-DL TA!**

Hello [insert pod-name],

I will be your teaching assistant for Neuromatch Academy - Deep Learning (NMA-DL). I am very much looking forward to meeting all of you and to a great academy. We will all learn a lot about deep learning, the questions that move us and the field, and learn a lot from one another. Let me briefly introduce myself:

My name is \_\_\_\_, I use (\_\_\_/\_\_\_) pronouns and I&#39;m a \_\_\_\_ at \_\_\_. My research is \_\_\_. I completed my studies in \_\_\_ at \_\_\_ . In my spare time I \_\_\_\_. I&#39;m really excited about all aspects of deep learning, and can&#39;t wait to share with you the amazing material the organizers have prepared.

**Administrative** : You should have received a number of emails from NMA over the past few weeks. Please make sure they don&#39;t land on the spam folder!!

**Discord:** You will receive an **invitation to Discord** , the forum we will be using for communication. You will receive this invitation **by email**** in the next couple of days**. Please watch your spam/promotions folder for this email too, just in case.

**Surveys:** If you haven&#39;t filled out the pre-course survey, please do:

1. [Pre-course survey (~15-20 minutes)](https://portal.neuromatchacademy.org/api/redirect/to/c5031f55-e6c8-4a64-a33c-c748c608141f)

If you already filled this out, you don&#39;t need to do it again.

**When and where/how do we meet?**

The Deep Learning course starts on **August 2.** We meet for the tutorials during our pod&#39;s time slot, which is \_\_\_\_. Every day, we will meet on Zoom at the same zoom link: \_\_\_\_
 It will also be pinned to our pod&#39;s channel in the Discord server. This zoom link will also be used for your group projects.

**Please use this widget to figure out which window of time our time slot corresponds to based on your own local time zone.** [**https://neuromatchacademy.github.io/widgets/tz.html.**](https://neuromatch.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dc4b2604ae26c6a9c9174a209&amp;id=03a7de6b52&amp;e=8b6291edee)[**You can also look at the NMA calendars, and add them to your own personal Google calendar -- in your local time zone -- at this link:**](https://neuromatch.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dc4b2604ae26c6a9c9174a209&amp;id=03a7de6b52&amp;e=8b6291edee)[**https://academy.neuromatch.io/calendar-summer-2021**](https://academy.neuromatch.io/calendar-summer-2021)[**.**](https://neuromatch.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dc4b2604ae26c6a9c9174a209&amp;id=03a7de6b52&amp;e=8b6291edee)

We will figure out which specific times to meet for working on projects before the Academy starts.

**Attendance and Certificate Award Policy:**

At the end of NMA you will receive an attendance and participation certificate if you are an active participant and do not miss more than 2 full days. Being an active participant means that you join the Zoom meetings and participate actively in the tutorials (using your microphone and participating in screen sharing. Just joining the zoom but not saying or doing anything &quot;interactive&quot; doesn&#39;t count! :). In addition, the certificate will have a project badge if you are an active participant and contributor to a group project. Rare exemptions and pre-scheduled conflicts will be considered on a case by case basis.
