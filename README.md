## **Neuromatch Teaching Demo Instructions**

As part of your application, we would like you to make a 4-5 minutes video that showcases your teaching. We don’t want you to spend too long making this video, certainly no longer than 1 hour, (for a fair assessment, longer videos will be penalized). You are not competing against others. We want as many qualified TAs as possible. Instead you are demonstrating to us that you are ready to teach! You can download a sample teaching demo for this tutorial in this repo, or see it on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKQxpM7CTZ8).

During the Neuromatch Academy summer course you will be leading hands-on tutorials live with a small group of students. At the end of each tutorial period you'll bring your whole group of students back for a short discussion, to review the answers to the tutorial and discuss further. Of course, in this teaching demo you're making for us there will be no live students. But we’d like you to review the first exercise in this tutorial as if there were a live audience (though you do not need to interact with this fake audience).

We essentially want you to: 1) get to know our tutorial, 2) open zoom and hit record and 3) explain one of the exercises as if you were with students who had just finished working that exercise.

In the remainder of this handout, we will provide a lesson plan for the tutorials (different for computational neuroscience and deep learning, as well as detailed instructions about what we would like you to submit.

You can run the jupyter notebook any way that you’d like, but we recommend using google colab to run the notebook. You can open the jupyter notebook manually through [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/), or hit this badge to load directly: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/blob/master/tutorials/W1D3_ModelFitting/student/W1D3_Tutorial4.ipynb)

You can access the jupyter notebook containing the tutorial here:
https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/tutorials/W1D2_LinearDeepLearning/student/W1D2_Tutorial1.html

For DL TA applicants we would like you to structure your five minute video with a slight more emphasis on the coding aspect. We will appreciate if your video follows the breakdown given below: 

* < 1 min: Introduce yourself. Give a few sentences about who you are!
* ~ 2 mins: Give a very brief recap of the concept of **AutoGrad** and explain why it is useful. While you should imagine that you are teaching a class of students, don’t feel the need to address them or ask them questions.
* < 2 mins: Work through the **Coding Exercise 2.1: Buiding a Computational Graph** explaining the solution code as you go.


### Evaluation and recording instructions
****How we will evaluate your video****

We are looking for people who are able to communicate well. We’re looking for quality over quantity, so don’t feel pressured to rush through everything. Instead, make sure the content you do get to is clear and easy to follow.

***Recording the video***

Because we are planning using Zoom during the Neuromatch Academy summer course, we’d like you to record your lesson using Zoom (instructions below). It should be a “single take” and you shouldn’t do any post-production work on the video. Don’t fuss about production quality! We are more interested in who you are than on the quality of your audio :-).
  
***Uploading the video to YouTube or Bilibili***

In your TA application you will need to provide a link to your sample teaching video. The easiest way to do this is to upload a video to YouTube and set the visibility setting to ‘unlisted’, as we’ve done for the sample. This means only people who have the link can view your video. Anyone can create an account on YouTube and upload videos for free. If you are in a country where YouTube is blocked, please upload your video to [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/).

***Length of the video***

As we mentioned we want the video to be 4-5 minutes long. You don’t have to conclude nicely -- feel free to cut the video at 4 minutes, even if you aren’t quite done. Making mistakes is ok! Point them out and use them as teaching moments. Do not feel the need to overproduce your video! We are trying to scale here, we hope you understand :-)

***Zoom Instructions***

-   Open Zoom and press “New Meeting” (or “Host a Meeting”).
-   Make sure your microphone is unmuted and your video is on.
-   Zoom has a variety of teaching tools you can take advantage of (though none in particular are required). Press the
-   “Share Screen” button and select one of the following:
-   Choose the window you have previously opened if you want to write code
-   Choose “Whiteboard” if you want to use the built-in whiteboard feature. Feel free to record an actual whiteboard if you have access to that as well, or to not use a whiteboard at all!
-   Choose “iPhone/iPad” if you’d like to share work on an iPad (having an iPad is not required).


- Some tips for sharing your screen:
	-   To change what screen you’re sharing, hover over the floating green bar with the meeting ID to bring up the menu and hit “New Share”.
	-   You can stop sharing your screen/whiteboard with the red “Stop Share” button.
    
-   When you’re ready to record, bring up the menu and (if you have screen sharing) press “More” then “Record on this computer” (or just “Record” and then “Record on this computer” if you’re starting without screen sharing).
    
-   Once you’re finished, hit the square Stop symbol to stop the recording, and then “End Meeting.” Once you’ve ended the meeting, Zoom will save the recording and should automatically open up the folder it was saved to (if not, go to “Documents/Zoom/[insert date of recording + name of Zoom meeting room]”).
    
-   Upload the mp4 file in that folder (which should be called zoom_0.mp4 or something similar).

### *Climate Match TA Application*

***Lesson Plan & Background***

For this tutorial you can assume that your students have learnt about:
- Climate science basics
- Numerical programming with NumPy
- Introduction to Xarray.
- Computations and Masks with Xarray

***Tutorial Description***

In this set of exercises we will:

- Load SST data from the CESM2 model
- Mask data using .where()
- Compute climatologies and anomalies using .groupby()
- Use .rolling() to compute moving average
- Compute, normalize, and plot the Niño 3.4 Index
You can access the jupyter notebook containing the tutorial here:
https://foundations.projectpythia.org/core/xarray/enso-xarray.html 

For Climatematch TA applicants we would like you to structure your five minute video with a  slight more emphasis on the coding aspect. We will appreciate if your video follows the breakdown given below:

1. (**< 1min**) : Begin with an introduction (who you are, your interests, etc.)
2. (**~ 2 min**): Give a very brief recap of the concept of El Nino Southern Oscillation(ENSO) and provide an instance of how this occurrence could be perceived in model simulation output, observational measurements, or paleoclimate data. While you should imagine that you are teaching a class of students, don’t feel the need to address them or ask them questions.
3. (**~ 2 min**): Walk through the process of calculating ENSO using Xarray. You can start from the section “Compute  the anomalies” to make a more efficient use of the time. Explaining the solution code as you go.

***Recording & Evaluation Instructions***
Please follow the instructions given in the [Deep Learning TA application](#evaluation-and-recording-instructions).
